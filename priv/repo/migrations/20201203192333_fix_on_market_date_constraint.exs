# Soooo in migration 20200717194021_add_on_market_date_to_listings.exs, I created
# a dependency on actual time (CURRENT_DATE) which ended up a bad design because
# it breaks reimport of data (since OMD is no longer valid at that point per the constraint),
# so I can't upgrade the DB for example.
# I didn't even consider this possibility, but hindsight is 20/20!
