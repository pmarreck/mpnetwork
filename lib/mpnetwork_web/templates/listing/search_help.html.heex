<h1>Search Examples/Docs</h1>
<div id="examples">
  To get the latest listings: Just hit Return with an empty search field.<br />
  To search by listing ID number: <pre class="search_example">5</pre>
  By listing agent name or broker name (note that all searches are case-insensitive):<pre class="search_example">daniel gale</pre>
  By address fragment: <pre class="search_example">55 plandome</pre>
  By price range (searches both rental price and list price; characters such as $ and , are ignored): <pre class="search_example">$500,000-1000000</pre>
  Listings owned by you: <pre class="search_example">my</pre><pre class="search_example">mine</pre>
  Your drafts: <pre class="search_example">my drafts</pre><pre class="search_example">my draft</pre>
  Listings owned by your office: <pre class="search_example">my office</pre>
  Manhasset school district: <pre class="search_example">SD6</pre>
  Port Washington school district: <pre class="search_example">SD4</pre>
  (You can also combine all of these with other filters like:)
  <pre class="search_example">my port washington</pre>
  <pre class="search_example">my 500,000-1,000,000</pre>
  <pre class="search_example">SD6 $500,000-$1,000,000 waterfront</pre>
  <pre class="search_example">my office UC</pre>
  <pre class="search_example">my office expired</pre>
  By listing status (note: use the all-caps short version for the most precise results):<pre class="search_example">NEW</pre> (or: FS, EXT, UC, CL, PC, WR, TOM) (or try:)<pre class="search_example">NEW or FS</pre>
  Inactive listings: <pre class="search_example">inactive</pre>
  By expired: (anything that is EXP status or has an expiration date in the past; can be used with other filters like "my expired")<pre class="search_example">expired</pre>
  An exact phrase (include double quotes in this case!): <pre class="search_example">"manhasset high"</pre>
  A range on certain attributes: <pre class="search_example">3-5 bedroom or 2-4 garage</pre>
  Or specific values of those attributes: <pre class="search_example">6 room 3 bedroom colonial</pre>
  (Available attributes you can search for a range on are: room(s), bed/bedroom(s), bath/bathroom(s), fireplace(s), skylight(s), garage(s), family/families, story/stories)<br /><br />
  You can now also search on date ranges of listing start date, under contract date, and closing date. Examples follow (all case-insensitive):
  <pre class="search_example">FS: 12/1/2017-12/31/2017</pre>
  <pre class="search_example">for sale:12/1/2017 - 12/31/2017</pre>
  <pre class="search_example">UC: 12/1/2017-12/31/2017</pre>
  <pre class="search_example">under contract: 12/1/2017-12/31/2017</pre>
  <pre class="search_example">CL: 12/1/2017-12/31/2017</pre>
  <pre class="search_example">Closed: 12/1/2017-12/31/2017</pre>
  Searches default to active listings only (listing status of NEW, FS, EXT, PC) unless you search on a specific listing status, or include the words "inactive", "unavailable", "all" or "expired". If you want inactive/unavailable listings, add the word "inactive" or "unavailable" to the search, or just add "all" to get everything. <b>Also note that UC (under contract) is considered neither "active" nor "inactive" currently and must thus be searched via "UC", "active or UC" or "inactive or UC"</b>.
  <pre class="search_example">inactive 1000000-2000000 3-5 bedroom 11050</pre>
  The word "all" (as well as specifying any listing status) will turn off the default filtering-out of anything not active. So if there's a listing at "5 Fancy Lane" which is under contract, sold, or has an unknown status, you can always find it via something like:
  <pre class="search_emample">all 5 Fancy Lane</pre>
  You can search by almost any other attributes: <pre class="search_example">expired tudor waterfront (solar OR windmill) 500000-1000000</pre>
  When searching by multiple attributes, it filters on all of them, so <pre class="search_example">rent waterfront</pre> will find rentals on the waterfront (rent AND waterfront).<br />
  You can also use and, or, not (or the equivalent symbols &, |, !) and parentheses:
  <pre class="search_example">rental (not waterfront) Tudor 11050 3-5 bed</pre>
  The only thing you can't currently do is a price range inside parenthetical groups with OR, so you CANNOT currently do something like (500000-1000000 or (my tudor)).<br />
