# This is the config file for the heroku/heroku-buildpack-apt buildpack.
# You can list packages
# libexample-dev
# or include links to specific .deb files
# https://downloads.example.com/example.deb
# or add custom apt repos (only required if using packages outside of the standard Ubuntu APT repositories)
# :repo:deb https://apt.example.com/ example-distro main
# The following are mostly libraries that libvips either needs or will use if present,
# taken from https://libvips.github.io/libvips/install.html
# and from the travis config file for elxvips
# And sorted alphabetically
# These package names expect Ubuntu as the OS
